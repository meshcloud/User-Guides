 4. The lower part of the first page provides you the possibility to tag your meshProject. Some tags are required to be specified by you. You can recognize the required tags by the red line on the left side of the input field.

 6. Now we come to the most important part. Chose at least one of the platforms for your future meshProject. The marketplace with interesting services provided by your organization is selected by default. If you want to have for example an AWS account pick AWS and select a provided meshLZ as well. Click next :arrow_right: ![Platform](PlatformAndLZ.png "Platform and Landing Zone")
